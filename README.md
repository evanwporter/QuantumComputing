# QuantumCircuit

QuantumCircuit simulator. Heavy inspired from looking at examples of Qiskit, though I have not used Qiskit.

[This](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/circuits/3_summary_of_quantum_operations.ipynb) was very helpful.

I enabled `strict` typing via Pylance since it keeps me honest and prevents bugs.
